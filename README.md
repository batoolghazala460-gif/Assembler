# Assembler
This project implements a complete two-pass assembler for the RISC-V 32-bit instruction set. The assembler takes an assembly source file and generates machine code in either hexadecimal or binary format. In the first pass, it scans the program to collect all labels and map them to instruction addresses. In the second pass, it translates each instruction into 32-bit machine code based on its type (R, I, S, B, U, J). The assembler includes full parsing for registers, immediates, and label-based branching with PC-relative offset calculation. It correctly encodes fields such as opcode, funct3, funct7, and immediate segments according to RISC-V specification. The program outputs results line-by-line into a destination file, handles errors such as missing labels or invalid syntax, and supports user selection of output format using -h or -b. This project demonstrates low-level architecture understanding, instruction decoding, file handling, and systematic compiler-style design.
